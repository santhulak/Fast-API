# Bank Note Authentication

## Project Description:
  The objective of the project was to classify whether a banknote is authentic or counterfeit based on various features like variance, skewness, curtosis, and entropy.
  
## Project Goal:
The Goal of the project was to built an API endpoint that accepts an image of a banknote as input and returns a prediction of whether the banknote is authentic 
or counterfeit. The API endpoint was implemented using FastAPI's asynchronous capabilities, which allow for faster and more responsive processing of requests.

## End Result:
